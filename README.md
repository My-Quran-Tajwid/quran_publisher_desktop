![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2510dfa-4913-4f1d-af32-b4aa8c8d71e6)

This project is inspired by the [Mus'haf Publication App](https://nashr.qurancomplex.gov.sa/) by KFGQPC.

This app aided the development of coloured tajwid fonts (in development)

## Download

Go to [releases](https://github.com/My-Quran-Tajwid/quran_publisher_desktop/releases) and find binaries for your OS. Currently available on Windows & Linux.

## Getting Started

Install Flutter: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

Clone repo with submodules:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/My-Quran-Tajwid/baca.git 
```

If you have previously git clone-d without the `--recursive` flag, run this command to get the submodules:

```shell
git submodule update --init
```

> [!TIP]
> To update the submodules next time, run this command:
> ```shell
> git submodule update --remote
> ```

Then, run the app: 

```shell
flutter run
```

(as of now, only tested on Windows)
